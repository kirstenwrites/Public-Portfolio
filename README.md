## Description

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Melissa Kinsey, a technical writer in St. Louis, Missouri (hey, don't blame meâ€”I just live here). This site consists of five pages, three of which I originally built as a homework assignment for the Columbia University Engineering Full-Stack Boot Camp (October 2020-April 2021).

\*Games Development:

\*Media & TV:

\*Other Fun Stuff: Retirement Communities in the US, press releases, 

\*Tech Writing: This page features some of my tech writing samples. I'm careful not to violate any NDA I've signed, so I tried to password protect this page using a .htaccess file. It didn't work. These samples don't give away any trade secrets, though, so I think it's safe to post them publicly. (No doubt the foreign governments following my GitHub will be disappointed.)

\*Contact (form): Call me! 867-5309. I've got a blank space, baby. And I'll write your name.
